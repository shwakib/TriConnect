# advancedSystemsProgramming_Project
This is the project on which I worked in my last semester. In this project, I had to create a client-server model where there will be 1 server and 2 mirror servers where each server will accept 3 connections. What next? The 10th client will be connected to server, 11th to Mirror1 & 12th to the 2nd mirror server.
After each connection, the client can request serveral functionalities based on the given input you will find in the project file.
